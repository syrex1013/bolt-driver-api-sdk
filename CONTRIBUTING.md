### Building

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Watch mode for development
npm run dev
```

## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Always specify return types
- Use interfaces over type aliases when possible
- Document all public APIs with JSDoc
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use meaningful variable names

### Code Style

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
export interface DriverInfo {
  driverId: number;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

/**
 * Get driver information
 * @param driverId - The driver's unique identifier
 * @returns Promise resolving to driver information
 */
async function getDriverInfo(driverId: number): Promise<DriverInfo> {
  // Implementation
}

// ‚ùå Bad
export type driver_info = {
  driver_id: any;
  first_name: any;
  last_name: any;
}

async function get_driver(id) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Error Handling

Always use custom error types:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
throw new BoltApiError('Authentication failed', 401, responseData);

// ‚ùå Bad
throw new Error('Auth failed');
```

### Logging

Use the built-in logger:

```typescript
this.logger.info('Operation started', { param1, param2 });
this.logger.error('Operation failed', error);
```

## Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

### Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

### Examples

```bash
feat(auth): add magic link authentication support

- Implement sendMagicLink method
- Add authenticateWithMagicLink method
- Update types for magic link flow

Closes #123
```

```bash
fix(api): handle rate limiting correctly

The API now properly respects X-RateLimit headers and implements
exponential backoff when rate limited.
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed

3. Add tests for any new functionality
4. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
5. Ensure code follows the style guide: `npm run lint`
6. Update the version numbers if applicable
7. Create a Pull Request with a clear title and description

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases

```typescript
describe('BoltDriverAPI', () => {
  describe('startAuthentication', () => {
    it('should send SMS when valid phone number provided', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should throw InvalidPhoneError when phone format is invalid', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- authentication.test.ts
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

All public APIs must have JSDoc comments:

```typescript
/**
 * Start SMS authentication for a driver
 * 
 * @param deviceParams - Device information including ID and type
 * @param authConfig - Authentication configuration with country and language
 * @param credentials - Driver credentials including phone number
 * @returns Promise resolving to authentication response with session ID
 * @throws {SmsLimitError} When SMS limit has been reached
 * @throws {InvalidPhoneError} When phone number format is invalid
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const response = await api.startAuthentication(
 *   deviceInfo,
 *   { country: 'PL', language: 'en-GB' },
 *   { phone: '+48123456789', driver_id: '123' }
 * );
 * ```
 */
```

### Wiki Documentation

When adding new features:

1. Update relevant wiki pages
2. Add examples to the examples directory
3. Update the API Reference
